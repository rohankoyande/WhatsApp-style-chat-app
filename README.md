# WhatsApp-style-chat-app
Just built a WhatsApp-style chat app using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB – and gave it a sleek UI using Bootstrap and AOS animations!
Features:
Add/Edit/Delete chat messages

Timestamped messages

"Seen", "Delivered", and "Sent" status ticks

Profile initials as avatars

Beautiful message bubble layout with AOS scroll effects

Learned a lot about structuring EJS templates, MongoDB schema design, and giving simple forms a mobile-like UI.
 No Socket.io or AJAX – this is all built with traditional form routes
